<p><a href="http://coupleteer.theodinspire.com/">Coupleteer</a> is a couplet generator. Using
some natural language processsing techniques, it builds pairs of rhyming lines
in iambic pentameter. The program&rsquo;s vocabulary and grammar were trained form
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and poems. The code for the project may be found on
<a href="https://github.com/theodinspire/coupleteer">GitHub</a></p>
